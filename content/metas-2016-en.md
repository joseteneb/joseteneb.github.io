Summary: This year I started considering something that I hadn't thought of in previous years. It's more or less a goal list.

This year I started considering something that I hadn't thought of in previous years. It's more or less a goal list.

This isn't a big thing, but it's important to me. Anyway, here it is:

* Pass a First Certificate Exam: I came to Ireland a few months ago with the idea of improving my English level. I think sitting for the exam is a good plan to show it.
* Write more: Maybe the most difficult of all. I have always intended to write more, but procrastination usually wins out.
* Travel to Iceland: One of my goals last year was to begin this one living in Ireland. Dublin and Iceland are separated by only 1476,14km, barely 10% of the distance between Argentina and Ireland.
* Participate in a 5K run: a very clear goal for this year, trendy and with a lot of offer. We'll see what comes out
* Take more pictures: The last year I took a photography course that led me to understand how take the photographs I want. 
* Carry out an important proyect: I have projects that I have started and have never finished and others that are just ideas that I have wanted to develop for a while. The point is to get to the end of the year with a project with which I feel plesead and satisfied.


The idea of making this list here is to track and check how it's going.
