Hi!, my name is **Jose Teneb**, I was born in Comodoro Rivadavia, a city in Argentinian Patagonia in '86. I'm curious, restless, passionate about learning and I spend a lot of time thinking about new ways to create a positive change.

This blog's purpose is to share some ideas, opinions, thoughs, knowledge and projects that I work on. In summary, it's a scrapbook of things that I like.

I am currently working as independent developer and consultant on projects related to technology and innovation. My experience allows me to get involved and give support in many areas,Â from the original idea to the completion of the project, always delivering quality and value to the client.
